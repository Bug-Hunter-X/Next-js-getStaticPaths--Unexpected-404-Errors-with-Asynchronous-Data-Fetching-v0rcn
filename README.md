# Next.js getStaticPaths: Unexpected 404 Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Next.js applications involving the `getStaticPaths` function and asynchronous data fetching.  The bug manifests as unexpected 404 errors, even when data for the requested paths should exist.

The root cause lies in inadequate error handling within the asynchronous operation of `getStaticPaths`. If an error occurs during data fetching, the function might return an unexpected result, leading to the generation of incomplete or incorrect paths, resulting in 404 errors for clients.

The `bug.js` file showcases this problematic behavior, while `bugSolution.js` presents a corrected version with robust error handling and a fallback mechanism to prevent such errors.  Refer to the files for a detailed understanding of the issue and its resolution.
